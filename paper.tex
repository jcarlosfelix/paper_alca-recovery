\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:1}

    Biologically inspired algorithms have proven to be very effective when
    solving complex optimization problems
    \cite{castillo2019comparative,valdez2021swarm,acherjee2020ultrasonic}, but
    the more challenging the problem, the more computing power it will require
    to solve them \cite{ontiveros2018high}. One technique to manage this
    processing power is to use distributed computing
    \cite{thain2005distributed} or the cloud available resources to help solve
    the problem \cite{garcia2013there,eshratifar2019bottlenet}. This strategy
    allows adaptation of the computing power according to the problem's
    complexity.

    Most frequently, bio-inspired algorithms are developed with a sequential
    (synchronous) perspective
    \cite{porto2018evolutionary,back1996evolutionary}, where a process must
    pause for the previous job to finish before continuing. In this research,
    we present an algorithm built as a native cloud solution, totally
    distributed, where its processes are executed asynchronously and in
    parallel. We designed the algorithm using the cloud available resources to
    distribute the processing workload among several computers or as a service
    in the cloud. This strategy allows to elastically increase (or reduce) the
    computing power according to the nature of the challenge
    \cite{armbrust2010view}.

    In previous work, we introduced an algorithm inspired by the biological
    life-cycle of animal species. As in nature, population individuals grow older
    and age. In this algorithm's reproduction process, couples must match by mutual
    attraction, where sometimes individuals won't procreate offspring because of
    the mate's low appeal. As time passes, the environment kills its individuals
    either because of low fitness or age, causing occasional population extinction.
    When this condition presents itself, it is required to create a new population
    to continue evolution (restart). We previously used to generate a new random
    set of solutions, with the cost of losing all evolution knowledge.

    The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to
    evolve a population of individuals, similar to a Genetic Algorithm (GA), using
    a distributed, parallel, and asynchronous methodology by algorithm
    implementation and testing. We improve the algorithm behavior by solving
    population extinction caused by nature's pressure in the Animal Life Cycle
    Algorithm with one of the most promising alternatives: the projection of the
    Elite towards the Champion, where we compare the results obtained with the
    latter and the random use of the more traditional alternatives (mutation and
    crossover), using classic benchmark functions for optimization for comparison.

    We present the description of the following sections in our paper. First, we
    illustrate our algorithm model, the encountered problem with the occasional
    population extinction, and our proposed solution in
    section~\ref{section.proposal}, followed by our experimental configuration and
    results in section~\ref{section.experiments}, where we continue to analyze and
    describe some of our research findings in section~\ref{section.discussion}. We
    finalize by presenting some inferences based on the results of our experiments
    in section~\ref{section.conclusions}.

    Our inspiration for this algorithm was found in the study and observation of
    nature, using general abstraction to identify what most animal species have in
    common: the life cycle. We present an algorithm inspired by the biological
    life-cycle of animal species, which consists of several stages
    \cite{read1968system}: birth, growth, reproduction, and death. The combination
    of those processes results in evolution. As in nature, we intend to execute all
    these stages in parallel and asynchronously on a constantly evolving
    population.

    \subsection{Algorithm Model}

        This algorithm seeks to imitate the natural life cycle, where new individuals
        are born at any moment and mature over time, where they age and then suffer
        mutations throughout their lives. In reproduction, couples match by mutual
        attraction. Death can happen to everyone: from a newborn to an aged adult,
        where the individual's fitness will impact their longevity. We display the
        general model concept in Figure~\ref{fig.algorithm_model}.

        \subsubsection{Birth} Birth is the first process of our algorithm, and it is
        responsible for the initial generation of individuals. This algorithm starts
        with a randomly generated population.

        \subsubsection{Growth} As in nature, all individuals constantly grow, mature,
        or age. With increasing age, individuals may lose strength but may also gain
        knowledge to solve problems. We represent this with a possible mutation in each
        increment of age.

        \subsubsection{Reproduction} This process will select random pairs of
        individuals to evaluate their attraction as a couple, where this attraction
        will depend on fitness. The better individual's fitness, the more attractive it
        will be. Not all couples will be compatible, so reproduction will not always be
        possible. When the breeding is successful, a new pair of individuals will be
        born (offspring).

        \subsubsection{Death} The death stage represents the challenges and adversities
        that life presents. This process evaluates the individual resistance to survive
        in the environment. The better fitness the individual has will increase its
        chances of survival. As time progresses, the demands of nature will also
        increase, pushing for only the best individuals to survive.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=80mm]{img/fig_algorithm_model.pdf}
            \caption{Animal Life Cycle Algorithm model.} \label{fig.algorithm_model}
            \end{figure}

    \subsection{Problem}

        In this algorithm's reproduction process, we find mating couples by mutual
        attraction, where sometimes individuals won't procreate offspring because of
        the mate's low appeal. As time passes, the environment could kill its
        individuals either because they have low fitness or age, leading to extinction,
        meaning there are no more individuals in the population left to reproduce. When
        this condition presents, if evaluations are available and termination
        conditions enable the algorithm to continue the search, it is required to
        create a new set of individuals. We illustrate the general flowchart for the
        Life-Cycle algorithm in Figure~\ref{fig.flowchart}.

        \begin{figure}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/fig_flowchart.pdf}
            \caption{Animal Life-Cycle Algorithm general flowchart.} \label{fig.flowchart}
            \end{figure}

    \subsection{Proposed Solution}

        In this article, we test various strategies to generate a new population to
        replace individuals that have already died (or were discarded) due to their
        aptitude, as happens in the life cycle. We previously used to generate a new
        random set of solutions, with the cost of losing all evolution knowledge. The
        strategy we describe in this paper uses elites to take advantage of the
        historical evolution, especially the best individuals, where we look for the
        offspring of the elite set to be somewhat close to them. We use the golden
        ratio to compute the distance between new individuals in the population, making
        an improved distribution.

        We propose one promising alternative to restart the population, to solve
        extinction caused by nature's pressure in the Life Cycle algorithm: the
        projection of the historically best-found candidate solutions (Elite) towards
        the best-found candidate solution (Champion). This article proposes some
        strategies to carry out this operation, where the presented distribution
        strategy obtained the best results.

        \subsubsection{How does it work?} 
            
            Based on the historically best candidate
            solution and the elite set, we use the Golden Ratio (shown in
            Figure~\ref{fig.golden_ratio}) to compute the distance between new individuals
            in the population, making an improved distribution. It randomly selects a
            solution from the elite set and uses the Golden Ratio to compute multiple
            solutions against the best-found candidate.

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=25mm]{img/fig_golden_ratio.pdf}
                \caption{Golden Ratio equation.} \label{fig.golden_ratio}
                \end{figure}

            This strategy is how we can calculate the projection of the historically
            best-found candidate solutions (Elite) towards the best-found candidate
            solution (Champion). To illustrate this concept we include
            Figure~\ref{fig.elite_projection}, placing the Elite solution on the far right
            and the Champion solution on the left corner, where a higher number of new
            solutions will be closer to the Champion.

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{img/fig_elite_projection.pdf}
                \caption{Projection of an Elite solution (found on the right) towards the Champion (at the left).} \label{fig.elite_projection}
                \end{figure}

            This process generates new solutions that will be the new population set. It
            uses the Golden Ratio to progressively approximate from an Elite solution to
            the Champion. This strategy facilitates to find apparently hidden solutions,
            having an exploitation emphasis. Figure~\ref{fig.elite_projection_swarm}
            displays the projection of five Elite solutions (on the corners) towards the
            Champion (in the center).

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{img/fig_elite_projection_swarm.pdf}

\section{Experiments}
    \label{section.experiments}

    As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the algorithm with Docker containers,
    where we compare the results obtained with the projection of the Elite towards
    the Champion strategy and the random use of the more traditional alternatives
    (such as mutation and crossover), using classic benchmark functions for
    optimization as implemented by the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in
    Python) library \cite{fortin2012deap}.

    \subsection{Experimental Setup} 

        The following tables show the configuration used to execute the experiments for
        the analysis and comparison in this paper. In
        Table~\ref{tab.general_configuration}, we can find the General Configuration
        for the Animal Life Cycle Algorithm. All values from this configuration
        remained constant during all phases of the experiment runs. The following
        table, Table~\ref{tab.benchmark_fun_config}, shows the values used for the
        Classic Benchmark Functions for Optimization, where these are adjusted
        accordingly for each function.

            \end{table}
        
        \FloatBarrier


    \subsection{Experiment Results}

        For each experiment, we ran 30 independent executions per algorithm and
        dimensions specified. We recorded the following results: best found error,
        standard deviation, total number of evaluations, and total elapsed time (in
        seconds). The labels used on the results of our summarized experiments tables
        are the following:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item   Error:       is the best found error (or best solution).
            \item   St-Dev:      is the standard deviation calculated from the error. 
            \item   Evals.:      is the total number of evaluations the algorithm executed.
            \item   Time:        is the total elapsed or wall clock time, in seconds. 
        \end{itemize}

        The alternatives to restart this new population are the creation of a new set
        of candidate solutions based on either: 1. Crossing the Champion with the Elite;
        2. The mutation with uniform modification from the Elite; 3. The
        projection of the Elite towards the Champion; 4. Based on random use of the
        previous alternatives. We compared three strategies by grouping the previous
        alternatives in the following:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item   Xover Mutation:      Crossing the Champion with the Elite, and the mutation with uniform modification from the Elite.
            \item   Elite Projection:    The projection of the Elite towards the Champion. 
            \item   All Random:          Based on random use of the previous alternatives.
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Ackley Benchmark Function Experiment}

            The goal of the first experiment was to confirm that this paper’s
            proposed strategy obtained improved results over our basic
            technique, which created a new population with a random generation
            of a new set of candidate solutions. We chose Ackley as the first
            Classic Benchmark Function for Optimization to test our algorithm
            behavior, where Figure~\ref{fig.fun_ackley} shows its corresponding
            Box and Whisker chart, and we summarized the results in
            Tables~\ref{tab.fun_ackley5} and~\ref{tab.fun_ackley10} (for five 
            and ten dimensions, respectively).

        \subsubsection{Bohachevsky Benchmark Function Experiment}

            As our second experiment to further validate and prove our
            algorithm behavior, we chose Bohachevsky Classic Benchmark Function
            for Optimization. Figure~\ref{fig.fun_bohachevsky} shows its

            The third experiment objective was to confirm Animal Life Cycle
            Algorithm continued finding solutions in a reduced number of
            evaluations. For this test, we selected the Griewank Benchmark
            Function for Optimization. Figure~\ref{fig.fun_griewank} shows its

            expected, in a reduced number of both time and evaluations. We
            selected Rastrigin Classic Benchmark Function for Optimization for
            this experiment. Figure~\ref{fig.fun_rastrigin} shows its

        \subsubsection{Sphere Benchmark Function Experiment}

            For our fifth experiment we chose the Sphere Classic Benchmark
            Function for Optimization. Even though the sphere function is
            considered one of the simplest to solve, the same behavior was
            consistent for the algorithm, where it showed a reduced number of
            evaluations and execution time. We can confirm this affirmation
            with the results shown in this experiment.
            Figure~\ref{fig.fun_sphere} displays its corresponding Box and
            Whisker chart, where we summarized the results in

        \subsubsection{Rosenbrock Benchmark Function Experiment}

            The goal of our sixth and last experiment was to study the behavior
            of the Animal Life-Cycle Algorithm when tested with the Rosenbrock
            Benchmark Function for Optimization. From all of our previous
            evaluation functions, Rosenbrock presented the most difficult
            challenge for our algorithm. This test facilitated the
            differentiation between the three compared strategies because the
            solutions found were in different numeric order. After all tests,
            the Elite Projection proved to be the best alternative. We can
            corroborate this by analyzing Figures~\ref{fig.fun_rosenbrock_5d}
            and~\ref{fig.fun_rosenbrock_10d}, which shows its corresponding Box
            and Whisker chart. We present the summarized results in

\section{Discussion}
    \label{section.discussion}

    Imagine being an astronaut on a mission repairing a space station in the
    middle of space. Suddenly, a block of asteroids hits the craft, and you
    lose your oxygen tank while the explosion pushes you away. From afar, you
    see the area where your tank might be, covered with something similar to a
    gas leaked from the station that blocks all visibility. Finding the tank is
    the only hope to return to your main ship some miles away. The oxygen
    reserve from your suit is running out, and there are only a couple of
    minutes left. Now hold your breath in real life and think, what strategy
    will you choose to search for your tank? We repeated this mental exercise
    several times until we found the best solution (or blacked out).

    If your life depended on it, would you choose a Genetic Algorithm, a
    variant of a Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, or another? We searched
    for a way to mix both, at least in some way, take the main idea or concepts
    from them and make them work together. We strongly believe it is possible
    to combine the features, as previous work has proven to obtain outstanding
    results \cite{garcia2015evospace,garcia2021event,valdez2021container,valdez2021swarm}.
    Our goal was to create a swarm out of the best individuals found in
    evolution. We probably have a long way to go, but at least we are getting
    promising results. From our experiments, all six Classic Benchmark
    Functions for Optimization (Ackley, Bohachevsky, Griewank, Rastrigin,
    Sphere, and Rosenbrock) proved the same behavior for the Animal Life Cycle
    Algorithm: finding the expected solution in a reduced number of evaluations
    and less execution time.


\section{Conclusions}
    \label{section.conclusions}

    The Animal Life Cycle Algorithm allows for multiple parameters'
    fine-tuning, facilitating the freedom to experiment with different
    alternatives to restart the population and solve extinction caused by
    nature's pressure, which will impact how quickly, and the quality of its
    found solution. We compared the results obtained with the use of historical
    elite projection versus other alternatives, using classic benchmark
    functions for optimization for comparison, where it showed favorable and
    promising results.

    As the nature of the challenge increases, it is indispensable to have an
    elastic, scalable, and fault-tolerant model designed with cloud
    collaboration processes, and asynchronous communication. We have proven
    that it is possible to evolve a population, using a distributed, parallel,
    and asynchronous strategy, inspired by the Genetic Algorithm (GA). To
    further validate this work, we could use some more demanding (or control)
    problem that requires calculating real numbers
    \cite{stanley2002evolving,miikkulainen2019evolving}. We implemented the
    algorithm using Docker containers.
