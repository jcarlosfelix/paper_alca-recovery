abstract="Several bio-inspired algorithms use population evolution as analogies of nature. In this paper, we present an algorithm inspired by the biological Life-Cycle of animal species, which consists of several stages: birth, growth, reproduction, and death. As in nature, we intend to execute all these stages in parallel and asynchronously on a population that evolves constantly. From the ground up, we designed the algorithm as a cloud-native solution using the cloud available resources to divide the processing workload among several computers or running the algorithm as a cloud service. The algorithm works concurrently and asynchronously on a constantly evolving population, using different computers (or containers) independently, eliminating waiting times between processes. This algorithm seeks to imitate the natural life cycle, where new individuals are born at any moment and mature over time, where they age and suffer mutations throughout their lives. In reproduction, couples match by mutual attraction, where they may have offspring. Death can happen to everyone: from a newborn to an aged adult, where the individual's fitness will impact their longevity. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the algorithm with Docker containers by solving the OneMax problem comparing it with a basic (sequential) GA algorithm, where it shows favorable and promising results.",
