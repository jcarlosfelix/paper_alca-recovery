  abstract = {Abstract Avian eggs represent a striking evolutionary adaptation for which shell thickness is crucial. An understudied eggshell property includes the neutral axis, a line that is drawn through any bent structure and whose precise location is characterized by the k-factor. Previous studies have established that, for chicken eggs, mean k corresponds to the golden ratio (Φ = 1.618, or 0.618 in its reciprocal form). We hypothesized whether such an arrangement of the neutral axis conforms to the eggshell of any bird or only to eggshells with a certain set of geometric parameters. Implementing a suite of innovative methodological approaches, we investigated variations in k of 435 avian species, exploring which correspond to Φ. We found that mean k is highly variable among birds and does not always conform to Φ, being much lower in spherical and ellipsoid eggs and higher in pyriform eggs. While 21 species had k values within 0.618 ± 0.02 (including four falcon species) and the Falconinae subfamily (six species) revealed a mean of 0.618, it is predominantly domesticated species (chicken, ducks, and geese) that lay eggs whose neutral axis corresponds to the golden ratio. Thus, the study of the mathematical secrets of the eggshell related to the golden ratio of its neutral axis suggests its species-specific signatures in birds.}

  abstract={Several bio-inspired algorithms use population evolution as analogies of nature. In this paper, we present an algorithm inspired by the biological Life-Cycle of animal species, which consists of several stages: birth, growth, reproduction, and death. As in nature, we intend to execute all these stages in parallel and asynchronously on a population that evolves constantly. From the ground up, we designed the algorithm as a cloud-native solution using the cloud available resources to divide the processing workload among several computers or running the algorithm as a cloud service. The algorithm works concurrently and asynchronously on a constantly evolving population, using different computers (or containers) independently, eliminating waiting times between processes. This algorithm seeks to imitate the natural life cycle, where new individuals are born at any moment and mature over time, where they age and suffer mutations throughout their lives. In reproduction, couples match by mutual attraction, where they may have offspring. Death can happen to everyone: from a newborn to an aged adult, where the individual's fitness will impact their longevity. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the algorithm with Docker containers by solving the OneMax problem comparing it with a basic (sequential) GA algorithm, where it shows favorable and promising results.},
